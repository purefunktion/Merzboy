# Version 3

This version has more updates as this adds new functionality and stuff to the GUI. A new GUI button controlled with the B button. Signs on the buttons and also a way to change between random and manual setting of the noise channels frequency & randomness register. 
Now you can put Merzboy in random mode and dial through random settings. When you find a sound you like you can put it in manual and that sound is one that is set. When you get bored put it back in random mode and dail in another sound.
