# Version 2

Adding a pseudo random number generator. This version plays random settings on the noise channels frequency & randomness register. No changes other than that. Check the commit messages if you want to check out the exact changes. 
It might seem that the application is silent on some of the random sounds and that is just how the registry work. Might make a function to avoid the silenty sounds in the future, but hey, this is electro-acoustic-experimental-noise-chance-music we are making here. Silence is part of teh beauty.
