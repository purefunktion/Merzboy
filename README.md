# Merzboy

Noise application for Game Boys.

# About

An application written in RGBDS assembly intended for use in noise "music". Rich with comments for learning purposes both for the author and hopefully the reader. Also versioned for every new iteration so you can follow code changes as the project evolves. From humble beginnings and onwards. There are too few easy examples of RGBDS code out there, in my opinion, so this hopefully fills a little gap.
