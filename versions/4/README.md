# Version 4

More GUI stuff, signs and a new switch to toggle between "Kill Switch" and "On/Off" mode.
In KS mode the sounds is on until you press the A button, when you releease it the sound turns on again.
In On/Off mode it is the other way around, not pressing == silence. Press A btn and beautiful noise 
fills the air. 
To switch between the modes you press the right or left buttons.
The merzboy.asm file is now 700+ rows so I will start to refactor and split the code in the 
upcoming versions.
